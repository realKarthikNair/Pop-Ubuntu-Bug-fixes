##### **1. Set keybinding for 'Show Desktop'**

e.g. to set 'Super/windows key'+'D' to show desktop 

    dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/show-desktop "['<Super>d']"

##### **2. Weird window characters that looks like e.g. @!0;BDHF open**

Fix: Disable any desktop icons extension(s) you're using eg [this](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2087/desktop-icons-ng-ding/)
*Unfortunately I dont see any solution to get rid off that without sacrificing desktop icons*
