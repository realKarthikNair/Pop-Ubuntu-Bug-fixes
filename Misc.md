##### **1 Spotify Linux client can't open playlist links**

There is no fix, the only workaround is to open the playlist in web player/ smartphone and like it/ add to library. That way it becomes visible on the side panel on Linux Client and easily accessible 

##### **2 Pop!_Shop simply doesn't open sometimes**

```
killall io.elementary.appcenter
io.elementary.appcenter
```
